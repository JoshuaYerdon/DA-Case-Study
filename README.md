# Background

# Tools I used
This was my first attempt at really analyzing and interpreting data. The following tools were used, each helping to shape my approach and streamline the process:

- **SQL :** I spent most of my time using SQL and worked with Visual Studio Code to run queries on the data.
- **PostgresSQL :** I was recommended PostgreSQL as a great tool for managing SQL queries. It provided a reliable environment for working with large datasets.
- **Google Sheets :** Being very familiar with Excel and Google Sheets, I used this for my visualizations of the data.
- **Git & GitHub :** I used Git for tracking changes to my code and GitHub to manage the project and share it with others.
